## 👋 About Me <h1>Hi, I'm Chioma Jennifer Obikili! 

a 💻 data analyst with a background in 🧠 training, 📊 workforce planning, and 🤝 customer service.

🔍 My journey into analytics began with a curiosity about how data can reveal patterns and drive smarter decisions. That curiosity turned into a passion, and I’ve since built skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau** to uncover insights and support meaningful action.

✨ What sets me apart? I combine analytical thinking with empathy and communication — helping teams not just understand data, but use it to solve real-world problems.

🚀 I’m passionate about applying analytics in fields like healthcare, education, and social impact, and I’m currently seeking **remote or hybrid opportunities** where I can grow, contribute, and collaborate.

📚 When I’m not analyzing data, I’m caring for my home 👨‍👩‍👧, reading a good book 📖, or exploring ways to keep learning 📈.
